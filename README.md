## Description üìñ

his is a Java program that reads a CSV file containing a list of products and generates a summary CSV file with the name of each product and its total value, 
based on the price and quantity. The output file is created in a new folder named "out" within the same directory as the source file.

The program uses BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to read and write files, and handles exceptions that may occur during file processing. 
The program also uses the Locale class to set the default locale to US, which ensures that the decimal separator used in the output file is a dot
(.) instead of a comma (,).

To run the program, simply compile the source file (Program.java) and run the generated class file.
The program will prompt you to enter the path of the CSV file you want to process. Once the program finishes, 
it will output a message indicating the location of the generated summary CSV file.

This program can be useful for businesses that need to generate summary reports of their product lists. 
It can also serve as a good example of how to read and write CSV files in Java using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.
